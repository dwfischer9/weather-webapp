# Weather Webapp
I created a website utilizing NodeJS and its Express framework that fetches and displays weather data based on a location input.
All weather data was retrieved using the OpenWeatherMap API, which can be found at https://openweathermap.org/api. I designed the site to be responsive, so that it looks good regardless of the size of the screen.


## What I learned:
* How to create dynamic webpages using a combination of EJS and HTML.
* How to retrieve data from an API and parse it.
* How to use Node.js and Express to create a web application.
* Make websites responsive for better use across different platforms.
* How to deploy an app to Heroku

### Next Steps:
* I would like to add functionality to the site such that the user's location is requested, and if allowed, searched for immediately, instead of a mostly empty page being present when first visiting the site.

#### Note: All source code is present, except for the OpenWeatherMap API key, for privacy and safety reasons.
